    """EN-dressed MP1 denominators for the T2^(1) doubles amplitude, built on demand for
    BOTH spin cases from the small (O,O)/(V,V)/(V,O) shift matrices.

    Why two: the Epstein-Nesbet shift is a diagonal Hamiltonian element of one
    DETERMINANT, so it depends on the spin case and does not collapse to a single
    spin-adapted number (see shifts.epstein_nesbet_shift_restricted_spinresolved). Every
    quotient a restricted U-block forms is a unique linear combination of the same-spin
    (aaaa) and opposite-spin (abab) T2^(1) amplitudes, so each half must carry its OWN
    denominator:

        with  v = g_oovv            (== t2_1_abab numerator, verified 5.6e-17)
              u = g_oovv - g_oovv_T (== t2_1_aaaa numerator, verified 8.8e-17)
        u/D -> u/D_same   and   v/D -> v/D_opp

    The decomposition is unique because u and v are linearly independent, so this
    substitution is exact, not a modelling choice.

    Spin bookkeeping for the opposite-spin case, in the abab convention
    [h0=i(alpha), h1=k(beta), p0=c(alpha), p1=a(beta)] (matches
    static_correction._build_dressed_denoms_uhf's abab branch exactly): the SAME-spin hp
    pairs are (p0,h0) and (p1,h1); the two cross pairs (p0,h1) and (p1,h0) are
    opposite-spin and carry no exchange.

    Holds only O(O^2 + V^2 + O*V) state -- the 4-index denominators are built per layout
    on request and can be dropped as soon as the amplitude that needs them has been
    divided, so nothing here forces an O^2V^2 array to stay resident. That matters at
    cc-pVQZ scale, where one O^2V^2 array is ~89 GB for hexacene.
