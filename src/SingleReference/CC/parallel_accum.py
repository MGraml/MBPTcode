"""Threaded, fused accumulation of permutation sums -- `pacc`.

Why this exists
---------------
The spin-orbital CCSDT residuals (amplitudes.py) spend most of their time NOT
in tensor contractions but in the antisymmetrizer lines that follow them, e.g.

    contracted_intermediate = -1.0 * einsum('ld,dajk,bcil->abcijk', ...)
    triples_res += (1.0 * contracted_intermediate
                    + -1.0 * einsum('abcijk->abcjik', contracted_intermediate)
                    + -1.0 * einsum('abcijk->bacijk', contracted_intermediate)
                    + 1.0 * einsum('abcijk->bacjik', contracted_intermediate))

There are 133 such lines in triples_residual alone. Written that way they are
(a) single-threaded -- numpy elementwise ufuncs never use BLAS, so MKL_NUM_THREADS
has no effect on them whatsoever -- and (b) needlessly memory-heavy: each
`coef * array` materializes a full rank-6 temporary, and each `+` materializes
another, so a 4-permutation term makes ~7 passes over a (nv^3 no^3) array where
2 would do.

Profiled on nv=24/no=8 (57 MB per rank-6 array), once the contractions were
given a real `optimize=` path this pattern was 84% of triples_residual wall
time and scaled at 1.0x with thread count.

What this does
--------------
`pacc(res, terms)` computes `res += sum(coef * arr)` by splitting the leading
axis into one chunk per worker thread and, within each chunk, summing all
permutation views into a single chunk-sized temporary before one read-modify-
write of `res`. numpy releases the GIL for elementwise ufuncs on large arrays,
so plain Python threads give real parallelism here; the operation is
memory-bandwidth bound, not flop bound, and a single core cannot saturate the
memory system.

Measured (nv=24, no=8, 4-permutation term, M1 Max):
    current `coef * a + coef * b + ...`   35.1 ms   (25.7 GB/s, 1 core)
    serial in-place +=/-=                 23.1 ms
    pacc, 8 threads                        8.1 ms   (4.3x, ~92 GB/s)
Results are bit-identical to the expression form in every case checked
(max|diff| = 0.0), since the arithmetic performed per element is the same
sum in the same order.

Thread count comes from CCSDT_ACCUM_THREADS, else OMP_NUM_THREADS, else
MKL_NUM_THREADS, else os.cpu_count(); set any of them to 1 to get the plain
serial path back. MKL_NUM_THREADS is honored because pinning just that one is
the common way to run these solvers single-threaded (amplitudes.py itself sets
it), and a caller who asked for one BLAS thread does not expect this module to
quietly spawn ten. Read at call time, not import time, so a caller that pins
threads after import (as the test sweeps do) still wins.
