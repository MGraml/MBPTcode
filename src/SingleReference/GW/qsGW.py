qsGW: the orbitals and the eigenvalues reinjected until the static Hermitian
self-energy stops moving.

evGW moves the eigenvalues and keeps the mean field's orbitals. Here a static
Hermitian self-energy Sigma~ replaces v_xc altogether: the Fock-like matrix
h + J[D] + K[D] + Sigma~ is diagonalized, its eigenvectors define the next
density, W and Sigma, and the cycle repeats to a fixed point that no longer
remembers the starting functional:

    eps, mo_coeff, info = qsgw_eigenvalues(mf, mol, screening='updated')
    info['cycles'], info['converged'], info['w_aux'], info['df_coeff']

Sigma~ is Marie and Loos's SRG-regularized form (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023,
doi 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00281). Its diagonal is that of Kotani, van Schilfgaarde
and Faleev's mode A, 1/2 [Sigma_pq(eps_p) + Sigma_pq(eps_q)] (Phys. Rev. B 76,
165106, 2007), with every term whose energy denominator lies within about
1/sqrt(2 s) of zero damped; off the diagonal the two differ at every s
(SelfEnergySolver.static_self_energy_matrix). Plain mode A carries each high
virtual's crossing of a pole of Sigma into the occupied-virtual block at size
1/eta, so its loop converges at some eta and not at others; the SRG kernel
bounds each coupling by the larger of its two denominators. `flow=None` still
selects mode A, with eta as the broadening. qsGW0 keeps the mean field's RPA
Casida solution, `screening='fixed'`: W stays, the amplitudes and the poles
follow the rotated orbitals. Restricted spin, Casida route only.

The DF factors are the mean field's, rotated into the current orbitals,
B_P,pq = sum_mn U_mp B_P,mn U_nq with U = C0^T S C, and never rebuilt: without
with_df they are an eigendecomposition of the MO-basis ERI, whose auxiliary
index would follow the orbitals and leave qsGW0's transition density, W and
the returned factors in three different auxiliary bases.
