"""Pieces shared by every imaginary-axis quasiparticle route.

The imaginary-frequency and space-time routes differ ONLY in how they produce
Sigma_c sampled on the imaginary axis. Everything downstream of that -- the
static Sigma_x - v_xc term, the Pade continuation to the real axis, and the
root search on the QP equation -- is identical, so it lives here rather than
being duplicated in each driver.

A route is therefore expected to supply just `(z_fit, sigma_iw)` and hand off.

    exchange: which K builds Sigma_x. 'mf' is the mean field's own, which on
        an ISDF mean field carries the grid's K error into the QP energy at
        FIRST order -- the v_xc part of that error cancels against the
        eigenvalue shift, the Sigma_x part does not (benzene HOMO 8.5 meV, a
        conjugated macrocycle ~30 meV). 'exact' builds the full-range K by
        direct integration; 'df' by density fitting with the STORED three-index
        tensor, which is naux nao^2/2 -- 84 GB at 1780 basis functions, 1.6 TB
        at 4736 -- so it is a small-molecule cross-check only. For production
        use `static_exchange_diagonal(exchange='df-direct')`, which holds no
        such tensor. v_xc is always the SCF's own operator: the eigenvalues
        came from it, and replacing it would break that cancellation.

    An attached solvent screening adds its first-order reaction-field
    (static COHSEX) operator here: the static self-energy is where the
    polarization energy lives, Sigma_c being second order in vtilde, and
    this matrix is the one static object every imaginary-axis route shares.
    None attached (gas phase) adds nothing.
