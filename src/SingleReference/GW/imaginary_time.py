"""GW self-energy in imaginary time.

The standard space-time construction: Sigma = i G W is a pointwise product in
imaginary time, so the self-energy costs no convolution.

    The whole chain in one call, with the outer contraction keeping both AO
    indices:

        Sigma_{mu nu}(tau) = sum_PQ X_ao[P,mu] (Zt_PQ * Ghat_PQ) X_ao[Q,nu]

    Two collocation matrices are involved and they are NOT interchangeable.
    Ghat needs the occupied/virtual split, so it is built from the MO
    collocation X_mo = X_ao @ mo_coeff; the outer indices are AO, so they use
    X_ao. Passing an MO-basis X for both silently returns Sigma in the MO basis
    instead.

    Cost per tau is O(M^2 N + M N^2): two GEMMs and a Hadamard product for the
    WHOLE matrix, not per element. That is the O(N^3)-for-everything claim --
    the frequency route needs O(N^3) per state, so it only matches this for a
    handful of states.

    Wt_tau: the screened interaction already on the time grid. Pass it when the
    caller built W blockwise (`screened_interaction_tau_blocked`) and W_omega --
    (nfreq, naux, naux), the largest array on this route -- was never formed at
    all; W_omega is then ignored.

    block_memory_gb caps the per-block working set. It does not change the
    answer or the flop count, only the peak allocation.

    coords + screen_r_cut (Bohr) drop (P, Q) block pairs whose bounding spheres
    are further apart than the cutoff. Sigma^{<,>}_PQ decays in |r_P - r_Q| --
    G at a rate set by the gap, Wt because it is screened -- so the surviving
    fraction falls with system size, which is where the cubic scaling is
    actually realized. A magnitude bound is NOT usable here: Cauchy-Schwarz on
    ||G[P]|| ||G[Q]|| discards the row overlap that carries the decay, and
    measured on benzene it drops 34% of pairs where only 3.7% are negligible.

    tau_indices selects a subset of tau points and returns that subset's
    contribution; the full Sigma is the sum over subsets, since the tau -> omega
    transform is a sum over tau. Distributing tau across ranks and reducing is
    therefore exact, with each rank threading its own GEMMs -- the same
    two-level split `chi0_imaginary_frequency` supports.

    Memory is (len(omega_out), nao, nao) complex -- the returned array and
    little else; the time points are folded in as they are built. Project it
    down with one of

        sigma_ao_to_mo           full MO matrix     -> qsGW, scGW
