"""Matrix-free Casida/RPA/BSE Davidson, with two ways of applying the same A/B.

The DF route contracts pyscf's three-index factor directly. What sets its cost
is `apply_exchange_direct`, which needs a (naux, nvirt, nvirt) intermediate --
the array that caps system size.

The ISDF (separable-RI) route replaces those contractions by Fock-like builds on
the interpolation grid. With

    (pq|W|rs) = sum_kk' X[k,p] X[k,q] Zt[k,k'] X[k',r] X[k',s],  Zt = D W_aux D^T

each block action is a few GEMMs and one Hadamard product,

    P[k,k']  = sum_jb X_o[k,j] z[j,b] X_v[k',b]     the trial vector as a
                                                    transition density on the grid
    [K z]_ia = sum_kk' X_o[k,i] (Zt * P)[k,k'] X_v[k',a]

so O(M^2 (n_occ + n_vir) + M n_occ n_vir) per trial vector, with no
(naux, nvirt, nvirt) array anywhere. This is the BSE counterpart of the GW
self-energy build in `GW/imaginary_time.py::self_energy_matrix_imaginary_time`,
taken statically at omega = 0. Foerster and Visscher, JCTC 2022,
doi 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00531 do the same
with PADF in place of ISDF.

The auxiliary GAUGE is the trap. pyscf's cderi is L^-1-whitened while a
separable RI fits with the symmetric V^-1/2, and the two differ by an orthogonal
rotation of the auxiliary index. A W_aux from one paired with factors from the
other is silently wrong -- every intermediate still looks self-consistent, and
in the GW work the same mistake moved a quasiparticle energy by 1.4 eV while
Sigma(i.omega) still agreed to 1e-5. `isdf_bse_factors` returns X, D and W_aux
from a single fit, which is the only reliable way to keep them in one gauge.

The Davidson GUESS is the trap the two routes share, and it is silent in the
same way: one unit vector per requested root returns `nroots` roots that all
report converged and are not the lowest ones whenever the smallest
orbital-energy differences are degenerate. See GUESS_FACTOR.

Where this reaches. At a chlorophyllide-a hexamer / cc-pVTZ -- 474 atoms,
nao 10980, naux 28236, and M 117762 on the published grids -- the DF route
would need a 21 TB (naux, nvirt, nvirt) array and 5.5 Pflop per trial vector,
and its static W a 2 TB (naux, n_occ, n_vir) one. The separable route holds Zt
at 103 GB, costs 29 Tflop per trial vector, and takes its W from imaginary time
instead. What is still missing at that size is Zt spread across ranks -- the row
tiling in `isdf_block_action` is already that decomposition -- and the ISDF
fit's own M x M Gram inversion, which lives in `separable_ri.fit_M`, not here.

    The probe is a property of the REFERENCE, not of the molecule. Twisted
    ethene has (at least) two converged RHF solutions 31 mHa apart, and

    up to 107 mHa) minao lands on the LOWER of three and '1e' is the outlier
    -- the reverse of ethene. So compare E_SCF across initial guesses rather
    than trusting any one; probe the reference you will actually use, with
    the kernel you will actually use; and if the probe comes back negative,

    the separable factors themselves and never from pyscf's cderi -- see the
    module docstring for what pairing the two costs.

    eps: orbital energies the RPA screening is built at, defaulting to the mean
    field's. A BSE@GW run passes the quasiparticle energies to
    `solve_casida_davidson` through `lr_solver.eps`, but W is normally still the
    G0W0 one, i.e. RPA at the mean-field energies -- so the two are separate
    arguments on purpose.
    counts: Lebedev sub-shell replica counts, i.e. the grid size -- the knob the
    factorization error responds to. `separable_ri.published_grids` is used
    automatically where it applies (H, C, N, O at cc-pVTZ) and the radii are
    optimized per element otherwise.
    factors: pre-built (X_mo, D), to reuse a factorization across states.

    screening:
      'imaginary-time'  chi0(i.0) built from the separable factors in imaginary
            time by `LinearResponse/space_time.py`, which is tiled and cubic and
            touches nothing bigger than (naux, naux). The only route that
            reaches production sizes.
      'df'  chi0 from the three-index factor these factors imply. Exact for the
            given factors, and the reference the imaginary-time route was
            checked against -- 1e-8 relative on the W entries at ntau=18 on
            water and ethene / cc-pVDZ -- but it forms B and then a
            (naux, n_occ, n_vir) array, which at a chlorophyllide-a hexamer /
            cc-pVTZ are 25 TB and 2 TB. Small systems only.

    ntau: imaginary-time points; 'auto' (the default) sizes the grid from the
    Kaltak-Klimes-Kresse test integral over the chi0 transition range at
    `tau_target`, exactly as the GW space-time route does -- but over that one
    range alone, since nothing here transforms a self-energy. A fixed value is
    not monotonically safe: the transform's Remez window closes above ~20 at
    molecular energy ranges and the fit COLLAPSES rather than saturating --
    measured against the 'df' reference on water / cc-pVDZ, 4.6e-7 at ntau=12,
    1.0e-8 at 18, and back up to 7.2e-4 at 24. The upward scan in
