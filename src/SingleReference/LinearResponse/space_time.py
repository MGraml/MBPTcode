"""Space-time RPA screening: the polarizability in imaginary time, then one
cosine transform to the imaginary-frequency axis.

With a separable (ISDF) ERI,

    (ia|jb) = sum_PQ X_o[P,i] X_v[P,a] Z[P,Q] X_o[Q,j] X_v[Q,b]

the particle-hole bubble separates into an occupied and a virtual half that each
carry only ONE orbital index,

    Pi_PQ(i.tau) = G^o_PQ(tau) * G^v_PQ(tau)          (elementwise)
    G^o_PQ(tau)  = sum_i X_o[P,i] X_o[Q,i] e^{+eps_i tau}
    G^v_PQ(tau)  = sum_a X_v[P,a] X_v[Q,a] e^{-eps_a tau}

so a tau point costs O(M^2 (n_occ + n_vir)) -- two GEMMs and a Hadamard product
-- against O(naux^2 n_occ n_vir) per frequency for the direct summation in
`imaginary_frequency.py`. That is the N^3-against-N^4 step, crossing over near
120 basis functions.

The transform is used one way only, on the model space it is fitted for
(Pi(i.tau) is a sum of e^{-Delta_ia tau} with Delta_ia in [e_min, e_max]), so
the minimax transform's lack of matrix duality costs nothing.

Sign convention follows `imaginary_frequency._f_rpa`: f(i.w) = -2 d/(d^2 + w^2)
and chi0 = 2 (C_ov f) C_ov^T; the cosine transform maps e^{-d tau} to
2d/(d^2 + w^2), hence the leading -2 below.

    The mirror term is not a small correction: e^{i nu_n beta} = 1 for bosonic
    frequencies, so tau -> beta - tau maps the integral onto itself and the
    mirror contributes exactly as much as the direct term. Dropping it is a
    factor of two at every beta.
