"""Symmetric Davidson eigensolver: the single iterative core behind both ADC
routes -- charged (IP/EA, root-following) and neutral (ee, lowest-k).

The iteration itself is pyscf's lib.davidson1. What lives here is the
problem-agnostic setup the two routes were duplicating: the Jacobi-Davidson
preconditioner, the overlap `pick` that root-follows a reference vector, the
lowest-diagonal seeding, and one tolerance contract.

Tolerance contract: `tol_residual` is a RESIDUAL NORM everywhere, and it is
the binding criterion. pyscf's own eigenvalue tolerance (`tol_eig` here, its
`tol`) defaults to the same number, which for a symmetric operator is the
looser of the two -- the Ritz-value error goes as |r|^2/gap, so a root that
meets the residual stopped moving long before. Pass `tol_eig` to decouple
them. This is deliberately NOT pyscf's own convention, where `tol` is the
eigenvalue tolerance and the residual tolerance is its SQUARE ROOT, so
conv_tol=1e-6 there silently means |r| <= 1e-3.

Not the solver for the other two eigenproblems in this tree: the Casida form
is non-Hermitian and paired (LinearResponse/davidson.py, pyscf real_eig) and
EOM-CC is non-Hermitian and biorthogonal (CC/eom.py, pyscf davidson_nosym1).
Neither reduces to this one.

    One pyscf quirk to know: davidson1 calls precond(r_k, e[0], u_k) -- the
    residual and Ritz vector of root k, but the LOWEST Ritz value for every
    root. The projection is therefore always exact (it uses u_k) while the

    diag: (n,) the operator's (approximate) diagonal. Used for the
        preconditioner AND, when x0 is None, for the seeds. It must be the
        diagonal of the operator `matvec` ACTUALLY applies -- if the caller
        shifts or projects inside matvec, the shifted diagonal is the one that
        belongs here.
    nroots: how many eigenpairs, clamped to n.
    x0: optional (n,) or (n, m) guess, used verbatim -- the caller owns its
        width. None seeds 2*nroots+4 lowest-diagonal unit vectors.
    pick: optional davidson1 `pick`; see overlap_pick. None takes the lowest.
    tol_residual / tol_eig: see the module docstring. The residual binds.
    max_subspace: cap on the number of trial vectors held. Storage peaks at
        roughly TWICE this, because davidson1 keeps the operator's image (ax)
        alongside the subspace (xs) -- at a doubles vector of no^2 nv^2 that

        products (see _default_subspace).
    max_memory: MB davidson1 may hold its subspace in. Above it the subspace
        goes to HDF5 files under PYSCF_TMPDIR, and the disk traffic can cost
        more than the matrix-vector products. It bounds the subspace only, so
        a caller holding other arrays passes what they leave free. None keeps
        davidson1's own default, pyscf's 4000 MB.
    max_cycle: davidson1 restarts by collapsing the subspace onto the nroots
        Ritz vectors alone, so it re-climbs out of a restart slowly and wants
        a generous budget.
    precond: override the default Jacobi-Davidson preconditioner.

        scaled with tol_residual by default and you almost certainly want
        that -- see _lindep_for.
