"""Separable RI (RI-RS) of Duchemin and Blase -- a THC factorization whose
CONSTRUCTION is O(N^3).

    (mu nu | lambda sigma) ~= sum_{kk'} X_{mu k} X_{nu k} Z_{kk'} X_{lambda k'} X_{sigma k'}
    X_{mu k} = chi_mu(r_k)          plain collocation, no weight factor
    Z        = M^T V M              V = (beta|gamma), the aux Coulomb metric

Same factorization form as any other separable/ISDF scheme. What differs, and
the entire point, is how M is obtained.

HOW FINE A GRID YOU NEED DEPENDS ON THE OBSERVABLE, NOT JUST THE SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fit residual is not uniform across orbital blocks -- the virtual-virtual
block is about 100x worse than occupied-occupied -- and whether that matters
depends entirely on how the observable contracts it. Measured on benzene/cc-pVDZ
with IDENTICAL factors and the same vv residual (1.9e-1):

    RPA   kernel never contracts the vv block              1.9 meV
    TDHF  adds only the bare-exchange vv contraction      65.0 meV

Same object, same residual, 34x apart. The rule that follows:

  * TRACE / INTEGRAL observables are safe at a looser grid. A GW self-energy
    takes G's virtual branch as a thermally weighted SUM over all virtuals,
    traced against W and integrated over tau, so vv fit errors enter
    sign-averaged and largely cancel. GW quasiparticle energies come out within
    0.6 meV of Casida through five acenes at the published cc-pVTZ grids.
  * POINTWISE KERNEL observables are not. A BSE exchange term takes specific
    (ij|W|ab) elements, coherently weighted by the exciton vector, with no
    cancellation. Same grid, ~5 meV at cc-pVTZ and 74.6 meV at the cc-pVDZ
    fallback grid.

So "is the grid converged" is the wrong question; ask which contraction the
quantity performs. Anything with a pointwise kernel -- BSE, and by the same
argument a dynamical kernel or an exciton analysis -- needs the tighter grid.

WHY THIS IS CUBIC AND LS-THC IS NOT
-----------------------------------
The least-squares THC route fits Z by contracting the co-density against
three-centre integrals, `einsum('ijq,gi,gj->qg')`, which is O(N^4) and was the
dominant cost once the polarizability went cubic. Duchemin and Blase instead
ask M to reproduce the RI-V FITTING
COEFFICIENTS of a set of test co-densities [JCP 150, 174120 (2019), eq 6]:

    argmin_M  sum_{rho, beta} ( F^RS_beta(rho) - F^V_beta(rho) )^2
    [D]_{k rho} = rho(r_k)                 test co-density sampled on the grid
    [F]_{beta rho} = F^V_beta(rho)         its RI-V fitting coefficients

which in Frobenius norm is `argmin_M ||M D - F||` with the closed-form estimator
(their eqs 8-9, with row balancing and Tikhonov regularization for stability)

    M = F Dt^T (Dt Dt^T + eps I)^-1 d ,    Dt = d D,  d = diag(1/sqrt(diag(D D^T)))

Only matrix products and one inversion: with the number of test co-densities
linear in system size, every step is O(N^3). eps = 4e-7 is their value for
double precision.

The other half of their scheme is that {r_k} is optimized ONCE PER ELEMENT
offline (eq 10, over Lebedev sub-shells replicated at optimized radii) and a
molecular grid is just the superposition of atomic ones -- so no per-molecule
grid search happens at all. `optimize_atomic_radii` here does the offline part.

Reported behaviour to check against: ~3x the auxiliary basis size (320 points
per C/N/O, 180 per H at cc-pVTZ/cc-pVTZ-RI), meV agreement with RI-V, empirical
exponent 3.07, crossover with quartic RI-V at ~350 electrons.

    s/p emphasis applied to the second AO index.

    PAIR SCREENING is what makes the whole scheme cubic. Duchemin & Blase: "due
    to the localization properties of the atomic orbitals, the number of atomic
    orbital products scales linearly with system size". Delesma et al. implement
    it as "only include pairs ij where the atomic orbitals have a significant
    overlap". Screening on the pair density the grid actually samples,
    max_k |chi_mu(r_k) chi_nu(r_k)|, is exact to the tolerance.

    BLOCKED over the first AO index, because the unscreened intermediates do not
    fit. At dodecacene/cc-pVTZ the full D_ao is n_k x n_ao x n_second = 425 GB
    and the three-centre array is 146 GB, against a 252 GB node; even hexacene
    needs 63 + 22 GB, which is most of the 142 GB peak that run showed. Blocking
    means only one block of each exists at a time, and screening is applied
    per block so the surviving columns are all that accumulate. Column ORDER is
    preserved -- blocks are processed in ascending mu -- so D and F stay aligned.

    block_memory_gb caps the per-block working set, and it is BOTH a memory and
    a speed knob -- the second half of that was got wrong once and is worth
    stating precisely. The total INTEGRAL work does not depend on how the index
    is cut up, but the number of `aux_e2` CALLS does, and each call rebuilds a
    shell-pair list over mol.nbas x auxmol.nbas. That setup is invisible on a
    small molecule and dominant on a large one:

        naphthalene/cc-pVTZ   nbas  138, aux  310   one call vs 138: 3.26 vs 2.99 s
        chl dimer/cc-pVTZ     nbas 1362, aux 3072   4 GB -> 2 AOs/block, 2034
                                                    calls, 8.5e9 pair-setups

    The measurement above was taken at nbas=138 and generalized to "block size
    does not affect speed", which is false by an order of magnitude at nbas=1362
    -- a production run sat in this loop for twenty minutes because of it. Size
    the budget from the node, not from the default.
    Every term is a sum over the first AO index -- the three-centre integrals,
    the LU solve (2 naux^2 per kept column), the F D^T product -- so splitting
    the index moves that work between calls without creating any. What it DOES
    create is one shell-pair setup per call, which is what the naphthalene
    measurement was too small to see.

    It does not change the answer. The screening keeps ~98% of columns at
    pair_tol=1e-10 at every block size -- the tolerance is far too tight to
    care that `col_max.max()` is a per-block reference -- and M agrees to
    3e-9 relative between a single block and 2-AO blocks.

    So: lower it when peak memory is the constraint, and do not raise it
    expecting speed.
