# mpi4py/ELPA are imported ON DEMAND, never at module import time.
#
# WHY (this is not a style preference): `from mpi4py import MPI` runs MPI_Init at
# import. If the interconnect is unavailable -- e.g. a compute node whose IB
# device returns I/O errors -- MPI ABORTS THE PROCESS from C. It does not raise,
# so the try/except that used to wrap this import could never catch it, and
# merely importing this module killed the job with a bare
#     Abort(...) Fatal error in internal_Init_thread ... ucx function returned
#     with failed status
# and no Python traceback. It reached callers that never use ELPA at all, via
# casida.py -> diagonalization.py.
#
# Deferring the import is the whole fix: code that never asks for a large
# diagonalization now never initializes MPI, so it cannot abort. Code that
# DOES cross the ELPA threshold still gets ELPA automatically,
# exactly as before -- no behaviour change where ELPA was actually wanted.
# Set MBPT_USE_ELPA=0 to force the scipy path even above the threshold (useful
# on a node with a broken interconnect, where MPI_Init would abort).
