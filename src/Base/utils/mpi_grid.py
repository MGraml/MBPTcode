"""Distribution of imaginary-time / imaginary-frequency grid points over ranks.

The space-time loops are sums over grid points, so a rank computes the terms it
owns and the results are added: no halo, no ordering constraint, and the answer
is bit-comparable to the serial one up to summation order.

mpi4py is imported ON DEMAND, never at module import time -- the same rule
`linearAlgebra/diagonalization.py` documents at length: `from mpi4py import MPI`
runs MPI_Init at import, and on a node whose interconnect is unusable MPI aborts
the process from C rather than raising, so an import at module scope kills jobs
that never wanted MPI at all.

BEFORE USING THIS, weigh the all-reduce against the compute. On a 1 GbE
interconnect the chi0 all-reduce (nfreq x naux^2) costs more than the compute it saves at
every acene size measured -- 2.3 s against 0.0 s at one ring, 121.7 s against
18.3 s at twelve. Distributing tau across nodes there makes the calculation
SLOWER. It pays on a fast fabric, or when naux is small relative to the grid
work. Job-level parallelism (one molecule or one state per node) needs none of
this and always scales.

Set MBPT_USE_MPI=0 to force the serial path.
