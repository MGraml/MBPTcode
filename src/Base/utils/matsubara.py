"""Finite-temperature (Matsubara) imaginary-axis grids: the intermediate
representation, plus the thermal regularization the T=0 grids need.

Why this is needed
------------------
Every imaginary-axis grid in `grids.py` is a T = 0 construction keyed on the
smallest transition energy e_min -- the HOMO-LUMO gap. `minimax_frequency_grid`
rescales a tabulated dimensionless grid by e_min and looks the table up by the
range ratio e_max/e_min; `gap_scaled_w0` sets the Gauss-Legendre scale to half
the gap. For a metal the gap is zero and all of it degenerates, silently:

    gap > 0 but tiny  ->  the grid collapses toward omega = 0
    gap == 0          ->  ZeroDivisionError
    gap < 0 (a numerically inverted, degenerate Fermi level)
                      ->  NEGATIVE frequency points AND negative weights,
                          returned without complaint

That is the whole of the metallic frequency-grid problem: not that the grids
are inaccurate for a metal, but that they are undefined for one and do not say
so.

The finite-temperature fix
--------------------------
At temperature T the low-energy cutoff is no longer the gap, it is the
temperature. Two things follow, and this module provides both.

1. `thermal_e_min` -- the cheap fix. Replace e_min by the first fermionic
   Matsubara frequency pi/beta when that exceeds the gap. The range ratio
   e_max*beta/pi is finite for a metal, so the EXISTING minimax and
   Gauss-Legendre quadratures become well defined again with no change to the
   self-energy assembly that consumes them. This is the temperature doing what
   the gap did, and it is the same physical smearing a Fermi occupation
   introduces.

2. `IRBasis` -- the principled one. The intermediate representation
   (Shinaoka, Otsuki, Ohzeki, Yoshimi, PRB 96, 035147 (2017); sparse sampling
   from Li, Wallerberger, Chikano, Yeh, Gull, Shinaoka, PRB 101, 035144
   (2020)), the finite-T basis used for Matsubara-axis GW by Zgid and
   co-workers. It is built from the SVD of the analytic-continuation kernel

       K^F(tau, omega) = e^{-tau omega} / (1 + e^{-beta omega})

   and depends on temperature and bandwidth ONLY through the dimensionless
   Lambda = beta * omega_max. No gap appears anywhere, so nothing degenerates
   as the gap closes. The singular values fall exponentially, so a metal at
   Lambda = 10^4 still needs only a few tens of coefficients, and the sparse
   sampling points are where those coefficients must be measured.

   This also settles the order of the analytic continuation. The basis size at a given
   (Lambda, eps) is the number of independent structures the screening can
   carry at that temperature and bandwidth -- so it is the natural, non-arbitrary
   order for the greedy-Pade continuation in GW/imaginary_axis, instead of a
   hand-set node count that has no reason to be right for metallic low-energy
   structure.

Nothing here is tabulated: the basis is constructed on demand from a composite
Gauss-Legendre discretization of the kernel and a dense SVD. GreenX, which
supplies the T = 0 minimax tables this repo already uses, has no
finite-temperature grids to borrow.

            yourself, as TimeFrequencyGrid.ir does
