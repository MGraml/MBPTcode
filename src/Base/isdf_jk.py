"""ISDF (separable-RI) J and K for the SCF, in place of a density-fitted cderi.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
pyscf's DF builds `cderi`, naux x nao(nao+1)/2, and streams it once per SCF
iteration. For the chlorophyllide-a dimer (178 atoms) at cc-pVTZ that is
nao = 4068, naux = 10420 -> 690 GB; and a range-separated hybrid such as
LRC-wPBEh builds a SECOND one for the erf-attenuated operator (see
`pyscf/df/df.py::range_coulomb`, which caches an entire parallel DF object per
omega), so 1.38 TB of node-local scratch, read every iteration.

The GW/BSE half of this pipeline already runs on the separable RI of Duchemin
and Blase (`src/Base/separable_ri.py`), where the same system costs 1.4 GB for
X and 3.6 GB for D. The SCF was the only consumer of the dense cderi left.

THE SAME FACTORIZATION, CONTRACTED FOR J AND K
----------------------------------------------
    (mu nu | la si) ~= sum_{PQ} X_{P mu} X_{P nu} Z_{PQ} X_{Q la} X_{Q si}

with X[P, mu] = chi_mu(r_P) on the interpolation grid and Z = M^T V M. Both
Coulomb matrices follow by contraction, with no three-index tensor anywhere:

    rho_Q = [X Dm X^T]_QQ                    diagonal only
    J     = X^T diag(Z rho) X                                    O(M nao^2)
    K     = X^T [ Z .* (X Dm X^T) ] X        .* elementwise      O(M^2 nao)

K is the expensive one and its cost is 4 M^2 nao, or 3 with the hermitian
shortcut -- the M^2-nao contraction appears twice, once forming the Hadamard
argument and once contracting it back. At the dimer/cc-pVTZ, M = 43076, that is
25.5 Tflop against DF-K's 112, and the largest object ever formed is a block of
rows of an (M, M) matrix.

AND ONLY K IS USABLE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE
-------------------------------------------------------
The two contractions do not ask the interpolation for the same thing. In K,
mu and nu sit on DIFFERENT interpolation points, each paired there with the
density -- a sum over occupied orbitals, therefore compact. In J they sit on the
SAME point as a co-density product X_{P mu} X_{P nu}, an arbitrary AO pair,
diffuse x diffuse included. `separable_ri.build_D_F` fits M against test
co-densities {all AOs} x {AOs with l <= l_max_second}, and `l_max_second` is 2,
so an f x f product is never in the test set at all.

Measured, benzene/cc-pVTZ on the published grids: the worst |dJ| element is a
carbon 4f with itself at 2.4e-1, against 1.1e-3 for the f block of K -- 222x --
and the SCF collapses by 129 eV. Widening the test set to l <= 3 takes that
element to 2.9e-2 and leaves K alone, confirming the mechanism, and the SCF then
collapses by 142 eV instead: the failure is variational, not one bad element.
So `j_route` defaults to 'df-direct': J from
pyscf's integral-direct DF-J, which stores no three-index tensor either.
ISDF-K on that footing lands within 17 meV of DF-K on the same auxiliary
basis, the size of the RI error it sits on top of.

WHAT IS STORED
--------------
Z itself is (M, M): 14.9 GB at the dimer. That fits in a node, unlike 690 GB,
so `z_mode='dense'` holds it. `z_mode='factored'` instead keeps L = V^{1/2} M,
shape (naux, M) = 3.6 GB, and rebuilds Z's rows per block. Measured on
benzene and naphthalene at cc-pVTZ, that is 1.6x the time for 2.4x less
resident memory -- and the ratio moves with naux/nao, so it widens as the
auxiliary basis does. `z_mode='auto'` picks from max_memory.

RANGE SEPARATION
----------------
The ISDF ansatz approximates the CO-DENSITY, rho_{mu nu}(r) ~= sum_P X_{P mu}
X_{P nu} xi_P(r), and the operator only enters through Z_PQ = (xi_P | w | xi_Q).
So a second operator needs a second Z and NOTHING ELSE: same grid, same X, same
fitting coefficients M, with V replaced by the attenuated two-centre metric.

It is also EXACT in the metric: Z is linear in V and V_SR + V_LR = V, so
K_SR(omega) + K_LR(omega) = K_bare to machine precision (9.8e-15, see
tests/test_isdf_jk.py). A refitted M_omega would forfeit that identity.

The residual worry is that M is fitted against the BARE Coulomb metric
(`separable_ri.fit_error_coulomb` is the objective the grid radii were optimized
against), so it is only minimized in that norm. `refit_omega=True` builds an
independent M_omega from attenuated three-centre integrals for comparison; the
measurement says the refit buys 3-4x on water and NOTHING on benzene (1.778e-2
either way), for a second full factorization. Reuse is also the numerically
safer route: the attenuated metric is singular where the bare one is merely
ill-conditioned -- 214 of 420 auxiliary functions in the null space on
benzene/cc-pVDZ-RI at omega = 0.2 -- and Z_w = M^T V_w M only ever multiplies
BY it, while refitting has to invert it.
