"""ScaLAPACK NUMROC: the block-cyclic split must account for every row.

`ElpaEigensolver._numroc` says how many rows of an n x n matrix a process owns.
Two defects sat here undetected because nothing imports the module without MPI
and ELPA installed, and neither is on PyPI:

  * `__init__` called it with 4 of its 5 required arguments, so constructing the
    solver raised TypeError before any of this ran.
  * the formula dropped the leftover blocks, so the pieces summed to less than n
    whenever nblocks was not a multiple of nprocs -- 8 of 10 rows at
    n=10, nb=2, nprocs=2, i.e. two rows of the matrix belonged to nobody.

The check is the PARTITION, not the formula: whatever NUMROC returns, the sizes
have to add up to n and no process may own a negative or over-long slice. That
catches a wrong formula without restating it.

Run: python tests/test_numroc.py
