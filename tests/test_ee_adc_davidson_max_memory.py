"""EE-ADC Davidson: the subspace gets the memory the SCF object's budget leaves.

pyscf's davidson1 holds its subspace in memory up to max_memory MB and in HDF5
files beyond. The EE-ADC routes pass it mf.max_memory, the budget of the whole
process in pyscf's convention, less what the process holds when the solve starts.

Water in cc-pVDZ at ADC(2), density fitted, 1s frozen: its singlet channel (above
the dense limit) goes through the Davidson. With mf.max_memory = 1 MB the budget
reaching davidson1 is 0 and the subspace goes to disk; with 10**6 MB it is that
budget less the process's use, under 10 GB here. Both give the same roots to
1e-10 Eh, since only where the subspace is stored differs. solve_symmetric called
without max_memory hands davidson1 none, so its other callers keep pyscf's default.
