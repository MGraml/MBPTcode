"""BSE@G0W0 needs two energy sets, and the 4-center builder has to be told.

The BSE diagonal carries the quasiparticle energies while W is screened at the
mean-field ones -- that split is what G0W0-BSE means. A three-index solver gets
it by construction, because its whole kernel comes from the W_aux it is handed.
The 4-center builder does not: it rebuilds the direct term's polarizability
itself and, before `eps_screen`, could only do so at the energies on its own
diagonal. Screening at the quasiparticle energies instead moves these roots by
24 meV -- larger than the auxiliary basis error it would be mistaken for, and
flat under grid refinement, since it is not a fitting error at all.

So the pins are: the default is unchanged, the argument reaches the direct term,
the two spellings of "screen at my own energies" agree bitwise, and once the
split is right the residual gap to density fitting is the fitting set alone --
the same size whether it is measured here or at a single energy set.
