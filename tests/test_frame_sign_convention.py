"""The five properties the ISDF frame sign convention has to have.

A frame axis SIGN carries no physics: every Lebedev sub-shell is an orbit of the
octahedral group, so negating an axis maps the shell onto itself and permutes
grid rows without moving a point. What the sign does control is ROW ORDER, and
anything indexed by a fixed grid row -- a gradient, a frozen adjoint, a
regression pin on the factors -- sees a row permutation as a discontinuity.

`atomic_frames` used to read the sign off the environment, as an odd moment
sum_j w_j (dhat_j . e_k)^3 with the first moment as fallback. Both vanish
identically for an axis with no neighbour projection, i.e. the out-of-plane axis
of ANY planar environment, so every atom of water fell through to eigh's
arbitrary sign. That is two defects at once: not reproducible across LAPACK
builds, and discontinuous exactly at the reflection-symmetric geometries.

No convention can be continuous everywhere -- equivariance at a symmetric
geometry would force an axis to equal its own negative -- so the test of the
replacement is not continuity everywhere but: total, deterministic, continuous
THROUGH planarity, covariant, and leaving both the energy and the grid itself
untouched. The last is exact rather than approximate: the two conventions
produce the SAME point set in a different row order, which is what keeps an SCF
checkpoint written under the retired rule consistent with a fit built now.
