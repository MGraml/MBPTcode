"""The static exchange of the QP step: every route must agree, and scale.

On the isdf route the QP step used to take Sigma_x from the mean field's own
ISDF-K, which puts the grid's K error into every QP energy at FIRST order: the
v_xc part of that error cancels against the eigenvalue shift, the Sigma_x part
does not (benzene HOMO 8.5 meV; a 178-atom conjugated macrocycle ~30 meV on
every BSE root). The alternatives that do not carry the grid are 'df' --
density fitting with the STORED three-index tensor, 1.6 TB at 4736 basis
functions, so a cross-check only -- and 'df-direct', which streams the
integrals once against the QP states and holds naux x nstates x nao at most.
They are the same RI expression, so they must agree to numerical precision, and
the streamed one must not depend on how the pass is blocked.
