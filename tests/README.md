# Tests

Standalone scripts, not a pytest suite. Each one runs a calculation, prints a
verdict per check and exits non-zero if any of them failed:

```bash
python tests/test_adc3.py
```

Almost nothing here is collected by `pytest`: the checks live under
`if __name__ == '__main__'`, so `pytest tests/` reports a directory of empty
files as passing. Run them as scripts, and **read the exit code** — a script
that prints `FAILURES DETECTED` is telling you something a green summary line
would not.

`test_imports.py` is the cheap one to run first: it imports every module under
`src/` in about a second and separates a missing `src.` module from a missing
optional third-party one.

## The ISDF and BSE tests, in the order they build on each other

These four are worth reading as a sequence, because each one guards a property
the next one assumes:

- `test_isdf_jk` — the J/K builder. Structure first (no three-index tensor is
  ever formed, `loop()` refuses), then accuracy against DF.
- `test_frame_sign_convention` — the interpolation grid is placed in per-atom
  frames whose axis SIGNS are pure gauge: negating one permutes grid rows and
  moves no point. Deterministic, continuous through planar geometries, and the
  energy invariant under every sign pattern.
- `test_grid_radii_optimizer` — the radii themselves, against Duchemin & Blase's
  published tables. The objective is multi-modal, so a single descent is a
  lottery; this pins that multi-start fixes it, that `n_start=1` still means the
  old single descent, and that recipes coexist in the shipped table.
- `test_static_exchange_routes` — the QP step's static exchange. `Sigma_x` built
  from the mean field's own K inherits the SCF route's error at first order, so
  this pins the streamed density-fitted build against the stored-tensor one and
  against the routing.

`test_davidson_isdf_bse` is the gauge test of the pair: the matrix-free BSE
action against the dense Casida solver, plus the negative control of pairing
ISDF factors with a cderi-gauge `W_aux`, which stays self-consistent and gives
the wrong spectrum.

## Reference data

`reference_data.json` and `adc_refactor_pins.json` hold pinned numbers several
tests compare against. Regenerating a pin is a deliberate act: it changes what
the suite considers correct, so the reason belongs in the commit that does it.

Optimized ISDF grid radii ship in `src/Base/data/optimized_radii.json`. The
per-machine scratch cache beside it (`src/Base/data/radii_cache/`) is
gitignored, because the radii optimizer is a numerically differentiated descent
under threaded BLAS and does not reproduce across thread counts — the shipped
table is what makes a clean clone reproduce the suite.
