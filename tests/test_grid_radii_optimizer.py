"""What `optimize_atomic_radii` has to get right, against the published tables.

Duchemin & Blase's SI Tables S8-S11 are ground truth for H, C, N, O at
cc-pVTZ, so the optimizer can be held to them rather than to its own output.
Two properties are checked there and the rest on the search itself.

The objective is multi-modal in the radii and the only lever measured to help
is start diversity. Carbon/cc-pVDZ at 148 counts, one descent per starting
shape, everything else at production settings:

    7.59e-02   4.50e-04   3.03e-03   1.03e-01   1.47e-02   2.61e-02

The first is the geometric ladder the single descent uses, and it is the worst
of the six -- it returns carbon's A3 shell as (0.199, 0.202), two coincident
radii duplicating 12 of its 36 points. Best-of-four is ~163x better for four
times the offline cost, paid once per (element, basis, counts) and cached.

Three things that look like fixes are not. A monotone reparametrization making
coincident radii unreachable was no better than the free one. Widening r_max
acts only by moving where the starts land: nothing sits on the bound, and the
result is not monotone in it. And sampling the nuclear cusp, which is worth
2.2-5.5x on the published tables, is worth nothing at 148 counts -- best-of-six
reaches 1.40e-03 with it against 4.50e-04 without, because a grid that has no
cusp point already spends a radius near zero doing that job.

Absolute fit errors are NOT pinned. The optimizer is a numerically
differentiated descent under threaded BLAS, so its result moves with the thread
count -- the same reason `shipped_radii` exists. Everything here is a ratio or
a structural property.
