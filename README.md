# MBPTcode

Many-body perturbation theory for molecular systems, on top of
[PySCF](https://pyscf.org/): Dyson IP/EA-ADC, MPn density matrices, coupled
cluster, GW and linear response. Co-authored by Claude.

## Methods

**ADC** — Dyson IP/EA-ADC in the algebraic-diagrammatic-construction
hierarchy of Schirmer, Cederbaum and Walter,
[Phys. Rev. A 28, 1237 (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.28.1237).

| branch | levels |
|---|---|
| RHF, spin-adapted (CSF basis) | ADC(2)-X, ADC(3) |
| UHF / spin-orbital | ADC(3) |

Both branches have dense and matrix-free (Davidson) routes, density
fitting, Epstein-Nesbet denominator dressing, and static self-energy
corrections.

**Density matrices** — MP2, MP3 and MP4 correlated 1-RDMs, restricted and
unrestricted, dense and DF, with Laplace-fused amplitude routes. GW and
CCSD/CCSDT density matrices too. Generated with pdaggerq.

**Coupled cluster** — CCSD and CCSDT amplitudes and lambda equations,
restricted and spin-orbital, plus EOM-CC (IP/EA/EE). Generated with pdaggerq.

**Screening** — static RPA screened Coulomb interaction W, and the screened
C^(1) block of the screened multichannel Dyson equation, following
Romaniello and Berger, [arXiv:2603.27329](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27329).

**GW / linear response** — G0W0 and eigenvalue-self-consistent GW on the
real and imaginary axes, Casida/RPA/BSE, RPA correlation energies.

Three routes reach the same quasiparticle energy and differ only in cost:

| function | how W and Sigma are built | cost |
|---|---|---|
| `calc_qp_energy` | Casida problem solved explicitly | O(N⁶) |
| `solve_qp_energy_imaginary_axis` | quadrature on an imaginary-frequency grid | O(N⁴) |
| `solve_qp_energy_space_time` | pointwise product in imaginary time, on a separable (ISDF) factorization of the ERIs | O(N³) |

A correlated density matrix is passed to any of them as
`dm_correction=`. The `dm_ccsd=` alias for that argument has been **removed**;
it was already marked deprecated, and callers that still use it now raise
`TypeError`.

**evGW** — `calc_qp_energy(..., self_consistency='evGW')` drives any of those
three routes to a fixed point: the quasiparticle energies are reinjected into
G and P₀ until the spectrum stops moving, with every eigenvalue updated, DIIS
acceleration and convergence decided on the HOMO and LUMO. The equation stays
anchored on the mean field while the screening follows the iterate — anchored
on the iterate instead, each cycle adds its own correction a second time and
the gap runs away without ever converging. `evgw_eigenvalues` returns the whole
converged spectrum and a record of how it got there. See `examples/12_evgw.py`.
`self_consistency='evGW0'` reinjects them into G alone: the mean field's P₀ and
W stay and only the poles of Σ_c move, on the Casida route.

**qsGW** — `self_consistency='qsGW'` (or `'qsGW0'`, W kept at the mean field)
runs the quasiparticle-self-consistent loop on the Casida route: a static
Hermitian self-energy replaces v_xc, h + J + K + Σ̃ is diagonalized, and the
orbitals and eigenvalues are reinjected until the density and the frontier
eigenvalues stop moving. Σ̃ is the SRG-regularized form of Marie and Loos
([J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19, 3943 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00281))
at flow s = 100 Ha⁻². Kotani's mode A (`flow=None`) carries each high
virtual's crossing of a pole of Σ into the occupied–virtual block at size 1/η,
so its loop converges at some broadenings and not at others. `qsgw_eigenvalues`
returns the spectrum, the orbitals and, for a BSE on top, the DF factors and
static W of the result. Restricted closed shell, gas phase.

**Low-scaling factorization** — the separable RI of Duchemin and Blase
([J. Chem. Phys. 150, 174120 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5090605)),
with optimized atomic interpolation grids. It backs the space-time GW route,
`solve_bse_isdf` (a BSE on the same factors), and ISDF-J/K for the SCF, which
replaces the density-fitted `cderi` and so removes the three-index tensor from
the memory budget.

**BSE** — the iterative (Davidson) Bethe-Salpeter equation, singlet or
triplet, in two interchangeable flavours that share every convention:
`solve_bse_isdf` on ISDF factors (one factorization for the GW that feeds it
and the kernel) and `solve_bse_df` on pyscf's own Coulomb fit. Both take
`self_consistency='evGW'`.

Which eigenvalues build the static W is set by the LEVEL OF THEORY: G0W0
screens W₀ at the mean-field eigenvalues, which is the standard split, and evGW
at its converged ones. An explicit `qp=` array therefore follows the G0W0
convention unless `screen_at='qp'` says the array is itself a self-consistent
spectrum.

**Solvent** — polarizable-continuum screening in the style of Duchemin,
Jacquemin and Blase, [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 164106 (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4946778).
Non-equilibrium solvation is two dielectric constants and needs both: the
ground state relaxes inside PCM(ε_static), since the solvent nuclei have had
time to reorient around it, and only the *response* is optical. One
`SolventScreening` carries both — `env.mean_field(mol, factory)` applies the
first, `attach_environment(mf, env)` the second, which substitutes v → v + ṽ
at the integral chokepoints.

Inside GW the reaction field is then Duchemin, Guido, Jacquemin and Blase,
Chem. Sci. 9, 4430 (2018), Eq. (18): the
self-polarization of the orbital carrying the added charge in the *screened*
reaction field, on every route, with Σ itself screened by the bare interaction
— screening Σ dynamically as well counts the same polarization twice. The
static COHSEX operator remains the fallback for the routes that never form W
(ADC, an unrestricted reference); the two differ by 0.39 eV of quasiparticle
gap on water in water. See `examples/13_solvated_gw_bse.py`.

**Finite temperature** — Matsubara-axis grids via the intermediate
representation, for systems where the T = 0 grids (which key on the HOMO-LUMO
gap) are undefined.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+, NumPy, SciPy, PySCF, opt_einsum and threadpoolctl:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pyscf opt_einsum threadpoolctl
```

`threadpoolctl` pins BLAS to one thread inside the quasiparticle root scan's
thread pool and is imported at module load by `GW/qp_energy.py`. Thread
settings are under [Threads](#threads).

`opt_einsum` is imported at module load by `CC/cached_einsum.py`, which most of
the tree pulls in, so it is not optional.

The coupled-cluster integral path additionally needs `openfermion` and
`openfermionpyscf`, imported only when they are reached:

```bash
pip install openfermion openfermionpyscf
```

The distributed eigensolve needs `mpi4py` and ELPA's `pyelpa`, both
optional; see [Distributed eigensolve](#distributed-eigensolve).

There is no build step. Run from the repository root so that `src` is
importable.

## Quick start

```python
from pyscf import gto, scf
from src.SingleReference.ADC import ADCSolver

mol = gto.M(atom='O 0 0 0; H 0 0 0.958; H 0.926 0 -0.240', basis='cc-pVDZ')
mf = scf.RHF(mol).run()

e, Z = ADCSolver(mf, level='adc3').solve()
print(f"ADC(3) IP = {-e[0] * 27.2114:.3f} eV   Z = {Z[0]:.3f}")
```

See `examples/` for density fitting, Epstein-Nesbet variants, open-shell
references, several ionization states, and screened singles.

## Threads

Set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to the number of physical cores the run may use. It sets
the OpenMP and BLAS threads of PySCF and NumPy, and the thread pool of the
per-state quasiparticle root scan (`calc_qp_energy(n_workers=...)`). The pool
takes `n_workers`, else `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, else one thread per CPU the process
may run on, and never exceeds those CPUs; `n_workers=1` gives the serial scan.

Leave `OMP_PROC_BIND` unset. Pool threads inherit the main thread's CPU mask, so
a bound main thread confines the pool to its own CPUs, often a single core; the
scan then warns and shrinks the pool. With the pip wheels, export
`OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE`: otherwise PySCF's OpenMP threads and NumPy's OpenBLAS
threads spin against each other on small calls.

In a Slurm job:

```bash
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread       # 16 cores; without it, 8 cores and their SMT siblings
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
export OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE
unset OMP_PROC_BIND
```

Several processes in one job step each get their own cores with
`srun --ntasks=R --cpus-per-task=T --hint=nomultithread` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS=T`.

## Distributed eigensolve

The dense eigensolves of the Casida route (`CasidaSolver.solve`, behind the RPA,
GW and dense BSE routes) and of ADC (`solve_dense`) can run on
[ELPA](https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/) over MPI ranks. They do so for a matrix of
dimension 5000 or more (their `threshold` argument) whenever `mpi4py` and
ELPA's Python binding `pyelpa` both import, on one rank or on several.
Otherwise, or with `MBPT_USE_ELPA=0`, they call `scipy.linalg.eigh`, as they do
for every complex Hermitian matrix.

Rank 0 runs the script alone; the other ranks wait to serve its eigensolves.
Open and close the script with

```python
import sys

from src.Base.utils.linearAlgebra.diagonalization import (serve_distributed_solves,
                                                          release_workers)

if serve_distributed_solves():
    sys.exit(0)                     # a worker rank, released by rank 0 at the end

...                                 # the calculation, on rank 0 only

release_workers()
```

On one rank, or without `mpi4py` and `pyelpa`, both calls do nothing, so the
same script runs serially. Call
`serve_distributed_solves()` before anything imports `mpi4py`: `pyelpa` refuses
to load after it, and every solve then stays on `eigh`. A failure inside a
distributed solve, on any rank, aborts the job.

Rank 0 still builds and holds each matrix and its eigenvectors, and runs
everything outside the eigensolve on its own threads. ELPA spreads the
eigensolver's work and workspace over the ranks, not the matrices' memory.

In a Slurm job, one node as 8 ranks of 24 cores:

```bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24
#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
export ELPA_DEFAULT_omp_threads=$OMP_NUM_THREADS
srun --mpi=pmix --cpus-per-task=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --cpu-bind=cores python run.py
```

ELPA's own OpenMP threads default to one per rank, and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` does
not reach them; `ELPA_DEFAULT_omp_threads` does, if `pyelpa` is linked against
the OpenMP build of ELPA (`libelpa_openmp`). Bind the ranks to cores, with
`--cpu-bind=cores` or `mpirun --bind-to core --map-by slot:PE=24`: unbound, a
test solve ran at least ten times slower. `--mpi=pmix` suits Open MPI 5;
`srun --mpi=list` shows what your Slurm offers.

`pyelpa` is on neither PyPI nor conda-forge. Build it from `python/pyelpa` in
the source of the installed ELPA version: with ELPA's own
`./configure --enable-python`, or against the installed library with this
`setup.py` in `python/`, ELPA's `.pc` file on `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, Cython
installed, `CC=mpicc`, and `pip install --no-build-isolation .`:

```python
import subprocess

import numpy
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from setuptools import Extension, setup


def pkg(flag):
    return subprocess.check_output(['pkg-config', flag, 'elpa_openmp'],
                                   text=True).split()


ext = Extension(
    'pyelpa.wrapper',
    sources=['pyelpa/wrapper.pyx'],
    include_dirs=[numpy.get_include()] + [f[2:] for f in pkg('--cflags-only-I')],
    extra_compile_args=[f for f in pkg('--cflags') if not f.startswith('-I')],
    extra_link_args=pkg('--libs'),
    define_macros=[('NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API', 'NPY_1_7_API_VERSION')],
)

setup(name='pyelpa', version='2025.01.002',     # the ELPA release
      packages=['pyelpa'], ext_modules=cythonize([ext], language_level=3))
```

Write `elpa` for `elpa_openmp` where ELPA was built without OpenMP. To check
the setup, run `tests/test_elpa_casida.py` under `srun` or `mpirun`: on more
than one rank it fails if a solve fell back to `eigh`.

## Basis sets from CP2K

CP2K's aug-MOLOPT families, all-electron bases with tiered RI sets built for GW
and BSE, are read from CP2K at run time and registered as PySCF basis names:

```python
from src.Base.basis.cp2k_basis import register

basis, aux = register('aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae', max_error=1e-4)
mol = gto.M(atom='O 0 0 0; H 0 0 0.958; H 0.926 0 -0.240', basis=basis)
```

Without `max_error` you get the tightest RI tiers: converged, but possibly far
larger than needed. Choose the tier deliberately; the RI name then carries the
largest Delta-I among the tiers it holds, so one name means one set. Data
sources, offline use and the trade-off are in `src/Base/basis/README.md`.

## Tests

The tests are standalone scripts that print their own verdicts and exit
non-zero on failure:

```bash
python tests/test_adc3.py
```

`pytest` collects almost nothing here — the checks live under
`if __name__ == '__main__'` — so run them as scripts and read the exit code.
`tests/README.md` maps which tests cover what.
