"""Cubic-scaling GW and BSE on one ISDF factorization.

The route for a large molecule: the SCF, the GW and the BSE all run on the SAME
factors. Reusing them is not only cheaper -- a second fit comes back in a
different gauge, and mixing gauges gives a wrong answer that still converges.

Two arguments of `solve_bse_isdf` are easy to confuse:

    factors=  the ISDF fit ONLY. Says nothing about whether a GW has run.
    qp=       the BSE diagonal. 'G0W0' (default) runs the GW itself; an array
              of orbital energies uses yours; False gives BSE@mean-field.

W is never passed: it is always built at the mean-field energies, which is what
G0W0-BSE means.
